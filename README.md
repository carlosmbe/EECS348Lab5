### Hello There!
This Repo has my EECS348 Lab 5 Code. 


C-NFL has the code for assignment 2 and uses multiple For Loops to producde the score combinations.

C-Sales covers assingment 1. The program assumes you have an input file containing sales. The sales should be serperated line by line, similar to the example given in the PDF. 


Please give the absolute file path to the program when genereating the reports.


### Thank You!!!

#### Example Usage

##### Compile
I compiled both programs by going to their directory and using 
`gcc main.c -o lab5`

##### Running Ass 1 (C Sales)
1. After compiling the code and running the compiled program. 

2. You're then prompted for the path of the `sales data`


3. I pass `/Users/carlos/Developer/EECS348/Lab5/CSales/sales.txt` 


4. Reports are then generated accordingly


##### Running Ass 2 (C NFL)



1. After compiling the code and running the compiled program. 


2. You're then prompted for score you'd like combinations for.
